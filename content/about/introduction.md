Hello! My name is Isaac Atta, I am a software developer and aspiring game developer that has recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have worked with various tools and programming languages but I have most of my experience with C++. In my free time I enjoy playing and learning about games and game development. My current work includes improving my skills in tools such as [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) aswell as in learning more about modern C++ standards and optimizations. I am currently not open to job offers. Links to other places where I can be reached are provided below:
